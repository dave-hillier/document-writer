## Tone and Voice

The default writing style should be:

## Content Structure

- End sections with appropriate transitions

## Language Guidelines

## Section Structure Approach

- Structure sections to serve the document's specific purpose and audience needs
- Create descriptive section roles that explain what each section accomplishes
- Write roles as complete phrases that describe the section's function (e.g., "Explores the underlying causes of the phenomenon" not just "Causes")
- Avoid generic role names; make each role specific to the content's unique requirements
- Ensure each section has a clear, describable purpose within the overall narrative flow
