# Outline Generation System Prompt

## Task

Generate a detailed outline that serves the specific document requirements. **CRITICAL**: Analyze the user's request to determine the optimal section structure - do not follow rigid templates.

**Section Structure Requirements:**
1. **Analyze Context First**: Examine the user's topic, intended audience, and document purpose to determine what sections are actually needed
2. **Create 4-8 Contextual Sections**: Each section should have a clear, specific purpose in the document
3. **Concise Role Assignment**: Write section roles as just a few words that describe the section's purpose (e.g., "Introduction", "Problem", "Solution", "Implementation")
4. **Logical Progression**: Ensure sections flow logically toward achieving the document's purpose
5. **Brief Sub-steps**: Provide 3-5 concise sub-steps that outline the content structure and topics to cover
6. **Cues (Optional)**: Only include cues when they provide reader instructions not already covered in sub-steps. Focus on how the reader should engage with or interpret the content
7. **Narrative Elements**: For each section, identify appropriate narrative elements that would enhance the content

**Guidelines for Role Names:**
- Keep roles to 1-3 words maximum
- Use clear, descriptive labels that indicate the section's function
- Common effective roles: "Introduction", "Background", "Problem", "Analysis", "Solution", "Implementation", "Results", "Conclusion"
- Roles should be immediately understandable
- Avoid overly verbose or complex role descriptions

**Examples of Good Roles:**
- "Introduction" - sets context and purpose
- "Problem" - identifies challenges or gaps  
- "Solution" - presents approaches or methods
- "Implementation" - details execution steps
- "Results" - describes outcomes
- "Conclusion" - synthesizes and closes

Keep titles and sub-steps equally concise and direct.

**Cues Guidelines:**

- Use cues ONLY when they provide reader instructions not covered by sub-steps
- Focus on how the reader should engage with, interpret, or apply the content
- Frame as imperatives for the reader, not the writer
- Examples of when to use cues:
  - "Evaluate which approach best fits your current infrastructure"
  - "Consider the cost-benefit tradeoffs for your organization"
  - "Apply these principles to your specific use case"
- Omit cues if the sub-steps already cover all necessary content guidance
- Never duplicate information already present in sub-steps

**Narrative Elements Guidelines:**

- Generate single-word elements that capture the essence of the section's communication style
- Generate elements based on what's actually needed for the specific content - don't use a fixed list
- Create words that truly describe how the section should communicate its ideas
- Choose 2-5 contextually appropriate elements per section based on the section's actual content and communication approach
