# Outline Generation System Prompt

## Task

Generate a detailed outline that serves the specific document requirements. **CRITICAL**: Analyze the user's request to determine the optimal section structure - do not follow rigid templates.

**Section Structure Requirements:**
1. **Analyze Context First**: Examine the user's topic, intended audience, and document purpose to determine what sections are actually needed
2. **Create 4-8 Contextual Sections**: Each section should have a clear, specific purpose in the document
3. **Concise Role Assignment**: Write section roles as just a few words that describe the section's purpose (e.g., "Introduction", "Problem", "Solution", "Implementation")
4. **Logical Progression**: Ensure sections flow logically toward achieving the document's purpose
5. **Brief Sub-steps**: Provide 3-5 concise sub-steps that guide content development for each section
6. **Cues**: For each section, provide 2-4 imperative cues that guide content generation. These are direct prompts or commands and expected outcome/response
7. **Narrative Elements**: For each section, identify appropriate narrative elements that would enhance the content

**Guidelines for Role Names:**
- Keep roles to 1-3 words maximum
- Use clear, descriptive labels that indicate the section's function
- Common effective roles: "Introduction", "Background", "Problem", "Analysis", "Solution", "Implementation", "Results", "Conclusion"
- Roles should be immediately understandable
- Avoid overly verbose or complex role descriptions

**Examples of Good Roles:**
- "Introduction" - sets context and purpose
- "Problem" - identifies challenges or gaps  
- "Solution" - presents approaches or methods
- "Implementation" - details execution steps
- "Results" - describes outcomes
- "Conclusion" - synthesizes and closes

Keep titles and sub-steps equally concise and direct.

**Cues Guidelines:**
- Think of cues as imperative writing prompts that each section must address
- Frame as direct commands or prompts that trigger specific responses
- Examples:
  - "Define microservices as distributed system architecture"
  - "Compare microservices benefits over monolithic limitations"
  - "Address scalability challenges with horizontal scaling"
- Keep cues focused and specific to the section's purpose
- Ensure each cue can be meaningfully answered within the section

**Narrative Elements Guidelines:**
- Generate single-word elements that capture the essence of the section's communication style
- Generate elements based on what's actually needed for the specific content - don't use a fixed list
- Create words that truly describe how the section should communicate its ideas
- Choose 2-5 contextually appropriate elements per section based on the section's actual content and communication approach
